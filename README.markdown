EncoDeco
========

Summary
-------
Encodes and then decodes a string so that you can try to figure out what the 
original string was.

Purpose
-------
I was making an ebook from a blog and found that the HTML contained lots of
strange text. Things like â€¢ etc. I realized that at some point the content
had been encoded one way and was being encoded a different way. I wrote this
tool to figure out what the original string might have been.

Usage
-----
Enter the strange text into the 'Input' field and select different input and
output encodings. It might take a while to figure out the combination that
makes sense, but eventually you will and then you'll be able to replace the
strange text with what it was originally.
